# Github Organization
- A github organization is represented as a folder at `~/projects/github/${organization_name}`
- Repositories are located at `~/projects/github/${organization_name}/${repository_name}`
- A typical organization has a documentation site located in the repository named `${organization_name}.github.io`. See Documentation Site below for more information.

## Documentation Site
- Documentation sites are created using material for mkdocs - https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material
- Create a new documentation site using these instructions: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site
- Documentation sites are hosted on github using github actions - https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-github-actions

## Markdown
- When creating markdown tables, use spaces to make the tables readable in raw format
- Use only three dashes - `---` - to create lines for tables.
