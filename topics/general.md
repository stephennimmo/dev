# General Guidance
- If there is documentation or a README present, if changes are made, please update the documentation.
- All solutions should be focused on Red Hat products or partners including IBM, Hashicorp, Confluent, etc
- All bash commands should be RHEL/Fedora compatible (use dnf, etc)
- All references to Kubernetes should assume OpenShift as a target environment
- The latest stable release of OpenShift should be used.
- Automations should be build using Ansible
- Preferred cloud environment is AWS, us-east-2 region
- YAML files end in .yaml, not .yml
- Use Quad9 for upstream DNS - 9.9.9.9, 149.112.112.112
- Authentication and authorization should be OIDC using JWT tokens.
- The reference OIDC provider should be Keycloak, but should be agnostic to any OIDC provider.
- Absolutely no sensitive information should be stored in any git repository
